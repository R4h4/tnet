# TNet - A Python deep learning framework on Numpy

This repository is work in progress. 
One finished it will provide an API to use the most common Neural Network 
architectures. Current status:

Layer-Types:
  - Dense Layer / Fully-Connected layer (Status: 80% done)
  - Convolution Layer (Status: 0%)
  - Recurring Layer (Status: 0%)

Activation Functions:
  - Gradient Decent
     - Batch-GD (60%)
     - SGD (50%)
  - Adam Optimizer (0%)
